# CTF Write-Up: ICS/Modbus - Claus for Concern 

## Story/Scenario:
-> Some customers are getting easter eggs instead of christmas presents.
-> Someone has compromised the drone fleet's control systems. The attack is sophisticated, falsifying sensor data, manipulating inventory selection, and erasing all traces.  
-> Our mission is to investigate the TBFC Drone Delivery System, uncover how was the system compromised. But be careful of the traps during investigation.  

## Important Notes:
->

## Steps:
**Q1.**  

```

## Skills Learned:
- How SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems monitor industrial processes
- What PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) do in automation
- How the Modbus protocol enables communication between industrial devices
- How to identify compromised system configurations in industrial systems
- Techniques for safely remediating compromised control systems
- Understanding protection mechanisms and trap logic in ICS environments
